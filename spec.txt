Pixel Art of Babel

PAoB is modeled after the Library of Babel. The principle of generating every
text possible is applied to images. PAoB is capable of generating any and every
image consisting of 8 basic color values in a 64x64 image.

8 possible cell RGB values:
    [
    (0,0,0),        # 0
    (255,255,255),  # 1
    (255,0,0),      # 2
    (255,160,16),   # 3
    (255,224,32),   # 4
    (0,192,0),      # 5
    (0,32,255),     # 6
    (160,32,255),   # 7
    ]

For remainder of this specification, these values will be referred to by their
indeces, given in # comments after each value above.

The core of PAoB is the image generation class, ImageGenerator. This
ImageGenerator has two main classes: 1) random_image, and 2) image_from_seed.

- random_image
    Take no arguments
    Returns random 64x64 image, represented as numpy array.
    Purely random, each cell has equal likelihood of being assigned each
    pixel value.

- image_from_seed
    Takes 1 argument - seed, represented as 64-base string [a-zA-Z0-9] and -,_
    Returns 64x64 image, represented as numpy array, corresponding to seed.
    The seed is converted to a base 10 number. This corresponds to the i-th
    possible image. Order or possible images is defined as:
        Start with full array of 0 pixels. The first 16 images are generated
        by incrementing [63][63] cell (bottom-right) by one. Once this value
        reaches 7, the next image is obtained by setting cell [63][62] to 1,
        then incrementing over cell [63][63] again. This pattern, like any
        counting system, continues for every image.

- seed_from_image
    Takes 1 argument - image, represented as numpy array.
    Returns 64-based seed, containing 2,048 characters.
    If passed to image_from_seed, this seed would produce the exact same
    image passed in to this function.

Seed:
    Seeds are represented with all lowercase and uppercase letters, digits 0
    to 9, and dash and underscore. The defined order is:
        0 - 9, then a - z, then A - Z, then -, then _

    Seeds are 2,048 characters long. Any seed with fewer characters will be
    front filled with 0s.

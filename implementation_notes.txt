Each image file is a 64x64 array. This contains 4,096 cells.

The seed is represented in a 64-base system. Thus, each character maps to a
unique pair of the 8-based cell colors. To convert from 64-based seed to
8-based cell color pair, use a dictionary with 64 key-value pairs.
    {
    0: (0,0),
    1: (0,1),
    2: (0,2),
    3: (0,3),
    . . .
    _: (7,7),
    }
There may be a more elegant way of doing this...

Also store a dictionary mapping color indices to their RGB values.
    {
    0: (0,0,0),
    1: (255,255,255),
    2: (255,0,0),
    3: (255,160,16),
    4: (255,224,32),
    5: (0,192,0),
    6: (0,32,255),
    7: (160,32,255),
    }

To generate a random image, simply build array, selecting random cell value at
each stage. Use random.choice(COLORS).

To generate an image from a seed, iterate over the seed one character at a
time. For each character, get the cell pair from the above dictionary, and
insert those values into the next 2 cells.

To generate a seed from a 64x64 image, take each pair of cells in turn. Do a
lookup to get the index of each value, then do a lookup with that pair to get
the seed character. Append that character to the end of the working seed str.
